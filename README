ALL SUBMISSION SCRIPTS, SOURCES, AND FILE PATHS WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED


DESCRIPTION OF ALL FILES:
plumed.dat - a sample plumed calculation of distance order parameters on a system of 252 sulfadiazine molecules solvated in acetonitrile
per  Santiso, Erik E.; Trout, Bernhardt L. (2011). A general set of order parameters for molecular crystals. , 134(6), 64109â€“0. doi:10.1063/1.3548889

plumed_simple.dat - a very simple and quick plumed inp for testing

SFD.pdb - 252 sulfadizine solvated in ACN

out.cop - the values of the distance order parameters in the PDB, which plumed will attempt to restrain

GMX_script - submission script, most likely need to be heavily modified to run on your machine (or not necessary)

PLUMED_script - runs a plumed driver for testing

sfd_cry.mdp, structure.top, topol.tpr, out.ndx - standard gromacs input files
